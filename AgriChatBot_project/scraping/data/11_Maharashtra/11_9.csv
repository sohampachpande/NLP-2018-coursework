Male goats are raised mainly for meat and not for breeding. For this reason males are castrated with an emasculator, or torsion forceps.

a) Ambia bahar (Jan-Feb)

b) Mrig bahar (June-July)

c) Hasta bahar (Sep-Oct )

How to do ?

  In this treatment, the irrigation is withheld 45 days prior to the flowering.
This facilitates the shedding of leaves.
  Spray Ethrel 2 to 2.5ml/lit of water for leaf shedding
The trees are then medium pruned 40-45 days after withholding irrigation.
The recommended doses of fertilizers are applied immediately after pruning and irrigation is resumed. This leads to flowering and fruiting.
Among three bahars, hasta bahar is recommended as the bacterial blight incidence will be low and fruits will be good quality and are exported.
Hasta Bahar

Harvested  during the month of March to April
They have very attractive rind with dark coloured  arils. the   
Fruits produced during this season are exported hence fetch high value.
Optimum water stress cannot be developed  during this period as withholding of irrigation  coincides with rainy season. This leads to poor  flowering and thus affect the yield.",Farmer asked about bahar treatment in pomegranate ?,Cultural Practices,JAYAD,HORTICULTURE,MAHARASHTRA

4. Use 13:40:13 or 19:19:19 during the growth period, but do not use 19:19:19 if there is a cloudy environment.
5. Use 12:61 or 00:52:34 at the time of full retention.

6. If the break starts, then substitute 00:52:34, potassium suneate, 13:40:13, and 00:00:50 by alternating it.
7. Allow calcium nitrate to be provided every 10 to 12 days after flowering. If there is a shortage of calcium, then black spots are made in the fruit bloom.
8. After giving calcium, you should give the boron in the next water. It helps in calcium uptake and also helps in the formation of flower beds.
9. Magnesium gives rise to 10 to 12 days after the immune system increases and the leaf greenness also increases.
10. Gradual growth of the skin is better than 10 to 15 days after Hummatic acid or Mycorrhiza (Rally Gold or IBN or VAM).",asked about fertilizer dose for tomato,Fertilizer Use and Availability,KHARIF,HORTICULTURE,MAHARASHTRA

(Don't tilt the weed) it breaks as usual. This experiment is successful in D & G type of soil (i.e., light to medium black soil). The waterman along with two female laborers can perform this simple experiment successfully and get rid of the lavala weed easily. The laborer should sit on the ridge horizontally so that they can uproot the weed in flowing water in the ridge and farrow & around. In general package of practice weeding is advised during 'wafsa' condition which does not serve the purpose for lavala eradication.",Eradication of lavala ?,Weed Management,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MAHARASHTRA

Due to lack of adequate donation, if the crop is found in the rain, the germination of the tooth is on the tree. The period of delay is short.
2) Growth: - This period is generally 30-45 days after the emergence of the pond. In the absence of this tree, secondary roots arise from the bottom of the tree to the fifth and it rises in the soil. In this condition, the plant is in full swing and leaves are completely made. As per the quality of the food, the leaves usually reach 15-20 leaves. This action continues till the plant starts.
3) Spillage period: - This period is from 45 to 60 days from the source. The turtle comes from the top of the flanks. In this way, the process of stomping expulsion generally begins for 15 days.
4) Period of timing of corn: - The first phase of the zodiacal particles begins to thrive in 2-3 days after crushing from the top of maize. From this grain, the woman gets out of control and on this woman, there is a combination of stamens produced from them, and it is seeded, on the granule, the leaves begin to flow out of the upper leaf.

- Seedling comes from 6 to 7 months of cultivation. After that, the yield of pods is 3 to 4 months.
