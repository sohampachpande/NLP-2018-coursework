I may add here that while following the above mantra to prepare Amrutpani, I have used the knowledge gained through my experiments and have followed some rules of our Ayurvedic system of medicine.

The best drainage of water from the medium to heavy (45 to 60 cm deep) is suitable for tur cultivation. This crop is not good in chopping, wet, saline soil. During the second week of July and the first week of July, when the sowing of the sowing occurs, and after the arrival of the sowing, the sow should be completed. Before sowing, add 5 grams of Trichoderma or two grams of thyroid, 2 gms of carbendazim to the per kg of seeds. After this, the seed group of rhizobium bacterial compound should be processed for every 10 kg seed.
ICPL-87 (120 days) for sowing, AKT-8811 (140 days), BSMR-853 (160 days), BSMR .- 736 (170 days), Vipula (145 - 160 days) These varieties should be selected. When planting inter-culturally, add turmeric (1-2), turmeric to excess sunflower (1-2), tur over soybean (1-3), tur to make more sorghum (1-2 or 1-4), tur (1- 6 or 1-8), tur must be sown in more groundnut (1-3), tur pea more (1-3), tur, more urad (1-2).
For continuous harvesting of the crop, add 45 cm to 10 cm for the earliest preparation of ICPL-87. Keep the distance. AKT-8811 for fun 45 by 20cm Keep the distance. 60 by 20cm for early flowering. Keep the distance. For Vipula, medium 90 duration, 90 by 20 cm Keep the distance.
Because the improved varieties respond well to the fertilizer and water, it is necessary to give the quantity of fertilizers in the right quantity. Five tons of good debris per hectare fertilizer or compost or organic fertilizer per hectare should be spread in the field during the last cultivation. During sowing, 25 kg of nitrogen and 50 kg of phosphorus should be given to 125 kg DAP per hectare.
