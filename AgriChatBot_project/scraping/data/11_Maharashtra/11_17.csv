      Supply of fertilizers is an important factor as it responds well to the fertilizers of bajavati kapas. 100 kg of nitrogen, 50 kg of phosphorus and 50 kg potash per hectare for hybrid cotton, and 80 kg of fodder for improved varieties should be given earlier in the field of fertilizers, or if fertilizers are low, after planting, take a small pit on each flower and fill it with fenugreek seeds and mix well in soils. Twenty percent of nitrogen and whole phosphorus and potash should be given at the time of sowing and the remaining nitrogen should be given in the same two installments after 30 and 60 days after sowing. Be sure to take 25 percent more chemical fertilizer (125: 65: 65 kg per) than the recommended amount of Bt oil.
      When using liquid manure, it is advisable to give quantity of fertilizers by studying the soil test report. In addition to the major components of nitrogen, phosphorus and cauliflower, micro-nutrients like magnesium, sulfur, iron, zinc, manganese and boron are also needed. These nutrients are available in soluble fertilizers. Due to the presence of micro nutrients, the stems can grow quickly after the growth of the straw.
