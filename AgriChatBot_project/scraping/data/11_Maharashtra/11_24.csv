All components of fertilizer are low-intensive for turmeric crop. However, the turmeric crop used to be beneficial for the use of natural compounds used by natural fertilizers. This is the experience of farmers. So, the amount of organic fertilizers should be used as high as possible. In this, complete weeding should be given to 10 tones (20 bullock cart) and Kalpataru Organic fertilizer from 75 to 100 acres of kadas (half a day during cultivation and half the amount during the filling). At the same time, give 200 to 300 kg of karni or neem cake and let it be filled.

If left to nature the trees may bloom and fruit irregularly through-out the year. 
In order to overcome this problem and to force a full crop in any of the three seasons, as required by the grower and the traders, Bahar treatment is practised in citrus orchards. 
The natural flowering of citrus trees is of very less intensity. Therefore the flowering is usually forced by withholding irrigation water. For forcing the trees to flower during February-March (ambebahar), the water supply to the trees is withheld for 40 to 60 days, i.e., from 15th November to end of December until the leaves show symptoms of temporary wilting. 
For mrigbahar (July flowering), about 40 to 50 days water stress (25% leaf drop) during May-June is sufficient to force the trees to flower.",fARMER ASKED ABOUT BAHAR TREATMENT IN CITRUS ?,Cultural Practices,JAYAD,HORTICULTURE,MAHARASHTRA
