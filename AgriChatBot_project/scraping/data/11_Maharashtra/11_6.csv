If weeds are high in excess, then after 15-20 cm distance in flat squats, sill the shallow lines and sow the seed and then cover the soil. Soak the steam well before sowing during summer season. And sow the seed after the arrival of wafa. For cottage cultivation, the seed requirement is 60-80 kg. Before sowing, it is necessary to process seeds for good germination. Before separation, separate seeds by squeezing coriander or wooden straw for separation of seeds. Before sowing, keep the boss for 12 hours in a warm place in water and then use it for cultivation. Therefore, germination increases by 8 to 10 days instead of 15 to 20 days and improves the production of coriander and helps in early recovery.",asked about cultivation of coriender,Cultural Practices,JAYAD,HORTICULTURE,MAHARASHTRA

  In this treatment, the irrigation is withheld 45 days prior to the flowering.
This facilitates the shedding of leaves.
  Spray Ethrel 2 to 2.5ml/lit of water for leaf shedding
The trees are then medium pruned 40-45 days after withholding irrigation.
The recommended doses of fertilizers are applied immediately after pruning and irrigation is resumed. This leads to flowering and fruiting.

If the make-up is good in the initial eyes, then a good set-up eyes can be used in case of pruning.
Tension before October pruning: If you give tension before the pruning, then food grains grapes in the leaves will be diverted to the teeth and eyes and it will benefit new fronts and will help to create a similar split.
Proper pruning and similar footprints: The proper pruning and removing a similar foot from the controlled eyes also have importance. The more expenditure on food, the more money spent on the eyes will be spent. Therefore, breeding problems can occur in many places. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the eyes with pruning and painting. Paste the right amount of pigmentation using hydrogen cation symmetry, and then remove the stems of a trunk, usually on one side and a few sterile feet for the extension. Growth opponents should be used if there is a problem with the bunch. At present, anti-resistance like CCC is not prohibited but it is not desirable to use it since the experiments are being conducted, so do not use other antivirals. The speed of growth of the valley is reduced by water and by the control of nitrogen. This time it is necessary to slow down the growth of the valley. It should be used properly for the control of nutrients. Avoid using excess chemicals in it and not using nitrogen and ga as long as the batch is not properly formed. During this avoid using the use of CVV ??extract or similar chemicals. After the improvement appears in the gauze, then start ga spraying.",asked about october prunning,Cultural Practices,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MAHARASHTRA
