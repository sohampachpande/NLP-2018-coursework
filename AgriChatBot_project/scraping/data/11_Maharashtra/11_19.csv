It is important for germination of germination of cotton, blossoming of flowers, filling of pots and filling, and the moisture requirement of the soil during these stages is important. Sowing should be turned down. After 3 to 4 days, give irrigation water. To provide adequate water for the intervals of 10-12 days according to weather and land clogging, till the monsoon begins and enough rainfall. Water should be given to the rain during the monsoon. However, it should not be more than 15 to 20 days in two currents. If the water supply is inadequate, give it water by using it as a whole.
