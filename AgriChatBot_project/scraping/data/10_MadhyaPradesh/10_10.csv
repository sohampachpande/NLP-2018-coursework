Method of making nadep

    Method of filling: Stitching the composting material thoroughly, fill the stitch only according to the order given below. Nadeep method only on the basis of picking the pickle, seal the composting material in a single day or in more than 48 hours.

    First stuffing: - Before filling the stitch, wet the wall inside the stitches and wet the floor with dough and water solution.

    First layer: - Vegetable substances fill the trash, stalks, branches, leaves etc. in the entire stitches up to a height of six inches. This 30 cubic feet will contain 100-110 kg of vegetative material. In this layer it would be beneficial to add 3 to 4 percent neem or green leaves of Palash. Which will control the termite.

    Second layer: Mix 4 kg cow dung in 125-150 liters of dung slurry and sprinkle it on the first layer so that the entire vegetative material is well dipped. Keep the amount of water in heat more. If you use biogas slurry then split 10 lit slurry into 125 to 150 liters of water.

    Third layer: - On the second layer of wet soil, lay cleaned clay 50-60 kg approximately equally. In this order of layers, fill the sutto with a hut of 1.5 feet above its mouth. Typically, the tank will be filled in 11-12 layers. After filling the stitch, apply a layer of 3 inch mud (400 to 500 kg) to sew stitches and leap from cow dung. If the cracks on this, then they should be leaned again.
    Second stuffing: - After 15-20 days, the material filled with stitches will shrink to 8-9 inches, then like the first feeding, fill the vegetative substance, dung slurry and clay soil laying the stitches up to 1.5 feet above their mouth. Seal and seal the same as the first filler.

    Precautions: - It takes 90 to 120 days to cook Nadep Compost. During this time, to prevent moisture and to stop cracking, the dung spraying of water will keep sprouting and the cracks do not fall. If the grass grows etc., then deplete it and keep moisture. If there is a strong sunshine then shade it with grass.

    Maturity of manure: - In 3-4 months, compost becomes dark brown and the smell cleanses well. Manure should not dry up. This compost should be filtered with a 35-sieve sieve in one feet and should be used again. The raw fertilizer, which came out from the sieve, should be used again to make fertilizer. The manure from a stitches can be given to 6-7 acres of land. A stitch of 160 to 175 cubic feet of filtration and 40 to 50 cubic feet raw material will be available. It means that a stitches get 3 tons (roughly 6 bullock cart) good cooked manure.
    Nadep stitching method, at least quantity of good quality manure is prepared in the dung. There is a possibility of getting 10 tonnes of manure from cow's year's dung. In which nitrogen 0.5 to 1.5 percent phosphate 0.5 to 0.9 percent and potash 1.2 to 1.4 percent.",Farmer wants to know information about organic fertilizer?,Government Schemes,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH
