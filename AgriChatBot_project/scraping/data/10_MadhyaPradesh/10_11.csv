Ginger should be excavated after about 8-9 months after planting, when the leaves gradually become yellow and dry out. Due to excavation, the quality and storage capacity of rhizomes decreases, and germination of rhizomes occurs during storage. Excavation can be done with the help of a spade or spade. Due to digging in very dry and humid environments, the yield is damaged, which should not be excavated in such time. After excavation, the clay should be cleaned from the leaves, soil and ginger in the ginger. If ginger is to be used as a vegetable, digging should be done within 6 months of planting. Wash the rhinoceros with water in the sun for one day. Dry ginger has been dug for 8 months, after dipping it in the water for 6-7 hours, then after rubbing it with coconut fiber or soft floss etc. should be cleaned. After washing, ginger should be dipped in solution of 100 ppm of sodium hydrochloride for 10 minutes. By which prevention of invasion of microbes creates the storage capacity as well as the storage capacity. For long, the incense ginger (low fibers) can be prepared after digging 170-180 days after the salt ginger can be prepared. After washing the soft ginger is prepared by taking 30 percent solution, which is immersed in 1% citric acid.
