To prepare the compost from the waste, the pieces of glass and metal pieces are separated properly and after this, a 10x4 ft platform is prepared to prepare the Vermi Compost up to 6 to 12 inches high. Two rubbish bricks are added above this platform and huts are made for shade above the platform. Dry fodder on the platform, manure 3-4 quintals of cow dung and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which gets irrigated by sapling for 10-15 days so that the temperature of the compost can be reduced. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and the microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.

After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries and the earthworms go down in humidity. Then separate the dry Vermic compost of the above. After 4-5 days, the upper manure of the stitches is dried and the dry manure is separated from the top. Thus, the entire compost separates from the stitches in 3-4 times and the earthworms are left in the last, whose number In two months, the number of earthworms inserted is doubled, keep in mind that do not use gantry, spade or cranberries to remove manure from hand. The manure taken from the strains is dried in a shade and filtered in a shady place. The quantity of Vermi compost requires 100 grams, one kilogram of one year plants and 6-8 quintals per acre in the crop. Using Vermicum Wash, it would be good to have two exhaust drains on the platform to collect the worm wash.",farmer want to know about  Vermi Compost Preparation Method?,Fertilizer Use and Availability,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH
