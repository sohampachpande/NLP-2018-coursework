Friend of earthworm farmers and the intestines of land are called. These concentrated substances spread humus and soil and spread them to other layers inside the ground. With this the ground is polar and the air traffic increases and the increase in storage capacity is increased. The action of chemical action and microbes in the stomach of earthworms increases the availability of nitrogen, phosphor and potash and other subtle elements found in the soil. Vermi compost does not contain stench and flies and mosquitoes do not grow and the atmosphere is not polluted. By controlling the temperature, the bacteria are active and active. Vermi compost gets ready within one and a half months. It contains 2.5 to 3% nitrogen, 1.5 to 2% phosphor and 1.5 to 2% potash.

Preparation Method:

The fertilizer is to be made from the waste, from which the pieces of glass and metal pieces are separated properly and after this, the platform of 10x4 feet is prepared to prepare the Vermi compost up to 6 to 12 inches high. 2 ridges are added to this platform and huts are made for shade above the platform. Dry fodder on the platform, fertilize 3-4 quintals of cow dung and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which gets irrigated by sapling for 10-15 days so that the temperature of the compost can be reduced. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and the microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.

After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries up and the earthworms go into humidity below. Then dry up",farmer need information about Vermi Compost method ?,Organic Farming,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH

Dry fodder on the platform, manure 3-4 quintals of cow dung and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which gets irrigated by sapling for 10-15 days so that the temperature of the compost can be reduced. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and the microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.

After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries and the earthworms go down in humidity. Then separate the dry Vermic compost of the above. After 4-5 days, the upper manure of the stitches is dried and the dry manure is separated from the top. Thus, the entire compost separates from the stitches in 3-4 times and the earthworms are left in the last, whose number In two months, the number of earthworms inserted is doubled, keep in mind that do not use gantry, spade or cranberries to remove manure from hand. The manure taken from the strains is dried in a shade and filtered in a shady place.

Termite control

    After the pomegranate is released from maize, after collecting the ginadians, they produce them in a clay pit and thicken the pitcher in the field so that the pitcher's palm has got out of the ground. Clamp the cloth over the pitcher and fill it with water. Only in a few days will you see that the termite is full in the pitcher. After that, take out the pitcher and heat it so that the termite is finished. Repeat this action by placing this type of pitcher at a distance of 100-100 meters in the field and by changing the girdioyo about 5 times. The termite will end in the farm.

    Put the betel-shaped asafoetida in a cloth and bind them in a stone and keep it in the drainage of water flowing towards the farm. It will destroy the termite and ugra disease.
