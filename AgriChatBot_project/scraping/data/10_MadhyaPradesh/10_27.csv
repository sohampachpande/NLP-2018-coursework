Dry fodder on the platform, fertilize 3-4 quintals of cow dung and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which gets irrigated by sail for 10-15 days so that the temperature of the compost can be reduced. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and the microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.

After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries up and the earthworms go into humidity below. Then separate the dry Vermic compost of the above. After 4-5 days, the upper manure of the stitches is dried and the dry manure is separated from the top so that the entire compost separates from the stitches in 3-4 times and the earthworms are left in the last In the stitches in 2 months, the number of earthworms inserted doubles, keep in mind that do not use gantry, spade or cranberries to remove manure from hand. The manure taken from the strains is dried and filtered in shade and stored in a shady place. The quantity of Vermi compost requires 100 grams, one kilogram of one year plants and 6-8 quintals per acre in the crop.

Dry fodder on the platform, 3-4 quintals of dung manure and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which is irrigated by the Jhara for 10-15 days to reduce the temperature of the compost fertilizer. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation from the flame for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.
After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries up and the earthworms go into humidity below. Then separate the dry Vermic compost of the above. After 4-5 days, the upper manure of the stitches is dried and the dry manure is separated from the top. Thus, the entire compost separates from the stitches in 3-4 times and in the last the earthworms survive, whose number In the stitches in 2 months, the number of earthworms inserted gets doubled, keep in mind that the manure is removed from hand.",farmer want to know information about method to prepare vermicompost ?,Organic Farming,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH
