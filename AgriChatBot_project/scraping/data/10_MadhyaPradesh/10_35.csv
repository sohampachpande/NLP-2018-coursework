Friend of earthworm farmers and the intestines of land are called. This concentrated substance spreads humus and soil into other layers inside the ground. This leads to soil pollution and increased air traffic and increased storage capacity. The chemical action and the action of microbes in the stomach of earthworms increases the availability of nitrogen, phosphor and potash and other subtle elements found in the soil. Vermi compost does not contain stench and flies and mosquitoes do not grow and the atmosphere is not polluted. By controlling the temperature, the bacteria are active and active. Vermi compost is ready within a month and a half. It contains 2.5 to 3% nitrogen, 1.5 to 2% phosphor and 1.5 to 2% potash is found.

Preparation Method:

To prepare the compost from the waste is to make the pieces of glass and metal pieces separately, and after this, a 10x4 ft platform is prepared to prepare the Vermi compost up to 6 to 12 inches high. Two ridges are added above this platform and huts are made for shade above the platform. Dry fodder on the platform, 3-4 quintals of dung manure and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which is irrigated by the Jhara for 10-15 days to reduce the temperature of the compost fertilizer. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.

After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries up and the earthworms go into humidity below. Then separate the dry Vermic compost of the above. After 4-5 days, the upper manure of the stitches is dried and the dry manure is separated from the top. Thus, the entire compost separates from the stitches in 3-4 times and in the last the earthworms survive, whose number In the stitches in 2 months, the number of earthworms inserted doubles, keep in mind that do not use gastric, spade or cracks to remove manure from hand. The manure taken from the strains is dried and filtered in shade and stored in a shady place. The quantity of Vermi compost requires 100 grams, one kilogram of one year plants and 6-8 quintals per acre in the crop. Using Vermicum Wash, it would be good to have two exhaust drains on the platform to collect the worm wash.",farmer want to know about wormy compost,Nutrient Management,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH
