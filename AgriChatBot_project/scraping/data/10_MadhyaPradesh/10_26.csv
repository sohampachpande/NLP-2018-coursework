Irrigation should be done immediately after harvesting of Kharif season crop, otherwise the possibility of delaying the plant will delay the irrigation. When the monsoon is harvested on the onion crop grown in Kharif season, irrigation should be done as per the requirement. It should be noted that there should be no shortage of water at the time of construction of Shalkankanda, because it is a revolutionary state of the onion crop, because in this stage there is a shortage of yield due to lack of water, while the excess amount of water purple smear (Pillar Batch) invites disease. The farm should not be dry for a long time, otherwise the Shalankand will burst and the crop will come soon, resulting in less production. Therefore, light irrigation should be done from 8-10 days intervals as required.

These concentrated substances spread humus and soil and spread them to other layers inside the ground. With this the ground is polar and the air traffic increases and the increase in storage capacity is increased. The action of chemical action and microbes in the stomach of earthworms increases the availability of nitrogen, phosphor and potash and other subtle elements found in the soil. Vermi compost does not contain stench and flies and mosquitoes do not grow and the atmosphere is not polluted. By controlling the temperature, the bacteria are active and active. Vermi compost gets ready within one and a half months. It contains 2.5 to 3% nitrogen, 1.5 to 2% phosphor and 1.5 to 2% potash.

Preparation Method:

The fertilizer is to be made from the waste, from which the pieces of glass and metal pieces are separated properly and after this, the platform of 10x4 feet is prepared to prepare the Vermi compost up to 6 to 12 inches high. 2 ridges are added to this platform and huts are made for shade above the platform. Dry fodder on the platform, fertilize 3-4 quintals of cow dung and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which gets irrigated by sail for 10-15 days so that the temperature of the compost can be reduced. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and the microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.

After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries up and the earthworms go into humidity below. Then separate the dry Vermic compost of the above. After 4-5 days, the upper manure of the stitches is dried and the dry manure is separated from the top so that the entire compost separates from the stitches in 3-4 times and the earthworms are left in the last In the stitches in 2 months, the number of earthworms inserted doubles, keep in mind that do not use gantry, spade or cranberries to remove manure from hand. The manure taken from the strains is dried and filtered in shade and stored in a shady place. The quantity of Vermi compost requires 100 grams, one kilogram of one year plants and 6-8 quintals per acre in the crop. Using Vermicum Wash, it would be good to have two exhaust drains on the platform so that the worm wash can be collected.",FARMER WANT TO KNOW ABOUT VERMI COMPOST ?,Organic Farming,JAYAD,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH
