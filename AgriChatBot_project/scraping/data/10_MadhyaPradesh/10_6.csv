Autumn sugarcane: - Use the amount of Natarajan in the Sharadik sugarcane divided into four equal parts and use it in 30, 90, 120 and 150 days respectively.
Basant sugarcane: In the spring cane, use total amount of nitrogen divided into three equal parts and use it in 30, 90 and 120 days respectively.
        The use of nitrogen fertilizer increases with the use of nitrogen fertilizers in the application of nitrogen in powder and simultaneous protection from termites. 25 kg Zinc sulphate and 50 kg Ferrous sulphate should be used for sowing the zinc and iron micro-elements at the interval of 3 years as basis fertilizers.",farmer want to know fertilizer application in sugarcane crop ?,Fertilizer Use and Availability,JAYAD,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH
