(20 May) A plan created by Krishi Vigyan Kendra to launch the technology on the ground will be the carrier of new revolution in the animal husbandry business. New fodder technology: To overcome the shortage of animal feed, Agriculture Science Center, Banka, on the technology level of urea treated animal feed Planned to be removed.

In view of this, there is a shortage of animal feed in the form of this, it is needed here and in this month, from 27th May, the animal husbandry will be trained in KVK for urea treated animal feed. The scientists said that the treated straw can be fed to the animals who make chewing more than six months of age. It is fertile and protein rich for animals. The option of treated straw will reduce the consumption of grain by 25 to 30 percent. What's urea treated bait: urea solution by making straw, wheat etc. Jidkav storage of dry fodder is upto the solution. The storage house should not be open during storage. Keep it off from the plastic. Stockman wood and wheat straw as the macro you want to be treated in a less than 10 quintals of straw treatment is accurate. 40 quinine urea and 400 liters of water is required for 10 quintal straw. At the same time, 4 kg urea is dissolved in 40 liters of water for treatment in low scale. Training to make animal husbandry in KVK from 27th May. Take the method of treatment 100 kg of straw and spread it on cement or pucca floor, spread the straw in the ground so that the thickness of the plate is about 3 to 4 inches above 40 liters of solution Sprinkle this spreading straw with Hazare, then roll the straw well with the feet or jump and press it. Over 100 grams of straw on top of the straw and again 4 kg of urea Dissolved in 40 liters of water and sprayed again pressed with the same process and the volume of their Hsiab whether it can stock. Now cover the treated straw with plastic sheets and put soil on the edges touching it in the ground so that if the subsequent gas does not get out of the plastic sheet, do not get the dough, put a little dry straw on top of it, dry dry soil or straw on it Leap smooth mud or dung can put up to three weeks and left Ucharit feed urea treated straw yellow color is dark brown.

At the time of treatment of straw, the prepared solution of urea should be kept out of the animals. The heat treatments in a pile of straw in 21 days and 28 days after the opening of the winter, before feeding the straw spread in the open air for about 10 minutes, the gas evaporates Jasise said. At the beginning, let the treated straw be treated to the animal, gradually eating habit after eating habit. Keep children away from the heaps of healing so that their
There is no adverse effect on health. It is said that the specially treated animal feed will be a boon for animal husbandry. This will reduce the cost of animal husbandry by 30 to 40 percent. This type of fodder is quite well-educated despite having intensive proteins and calcium. Due to its use, milk production will also increase.

Seeding depth is 5-10mm in moist topsoil. Depending on the variety of seeds, the area is drilled into the litter and are ready to harvest after 120-180 days. In the United States, the lineage is sown at a rate of 7kg / hectare, between 30-50 cm rows, and 50-250 kg / ha with hectare applied. Recently Australian research has shown that it is best for some soil moisture for sowing, and that moisture is present for at least 7 days during germination / emergence phase. Dry sowing has failed in this Australian research. (- 85% higher, higher germination percentage i.e. recently produced seeds) In addition, the importance of research has highlighted the importance of extraordinary seeds.

Friend of earthworm farmers and the intestines of land are called. These concentrated substances spread humus and soil and spread them to other layers inside the ground. With this the ground is polar and the air traffic increases and the increase in storage capacity is increased. The action of chemical action and microbes in the stomach of earthworms increases the availability of nitrogen, phosphor and potash and other subtle elements found in the soil. Vermi compost does not contain stench and flies and mosquitoes do not grow and the atmosphere is not polluted. By controlling the temperature, the bacteria are active and active. Vermi compost gets ready within one and a half months. It contains 2.5 to 3% nitrogen, 1.5 to 2% phosphor and 1.5 to 2% potash.

Preparation Method:

The fertilizer is to be made from the waste, from which the pieces of glass and metal pieces are separated properly and after this, the platform of 10x4 feet is prepared to prepare the Vermi compost up to 6 to 12 inches high. 2 ridges are added to this platform and huts are made for shade above the platform. Dry fodder on the platform, fertilize 3-4 quintals of cow dung and 7-8 quintals of garbage (Garvage) Which gets irrigated by sapling for 10-15 days so that the temperature of the compost can be reduced. After this, 100 thousand square feet are left to the extent of 10 thousand earthworms. After leaving the ketchu, the stitches are covered with jute sacks, and they keep irrigation for 4 days so that 45-50 percent moisture is maintained. Keep in mind that due to excessive wetness the air will be blocked and the microbes and earthworms will not be able to die or work.

After 45 days irrigation is stopped and jute bags are removed. After removing the brood, the top manure dries up and the earthworms go into humidity below. Then dry up",farmer need information about Vermi Compost method ?,Organic Farming,KHARIF,AGRICULTURE,MADHYA PRADESH
