The topic is Word Sense Disambiguation. The problem and algorithms are briefly discussed with examples.

I have implemented 3 algorithms:
  1. Lesk's algorithm
  2. Random Walk algorithm
  3. Walker's algorithm

Instruction:
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the blocks.

The Jupyter notebook contains the code as well as the write-up on the topic

Modify the sentence and ambiguous_word field inside the "What is the confusion about?" block as required.
